#Welcome;Welcome to the interactive tour for the murine melanoma CD8 TIL Explorer, a tool to enable exploration of the tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cell scRNA-seq dataset described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402X.2020.1737369">(Carmona et al. 2020)</a>. The dataset contains 7 samples from    individually processed untreated B16 melanoma tumors.<br/><br/> The user interface is a customized version of the iSEE Explorer.<br/><br/> You will be shown around the different components of the WebApp. Highlighted elements will respond to the user's actions, while the rest of the UI will be shaded. You will be prompted at particular spots to perform some actions, which will be marked with "<strong>Action:</strong>" text. <br/><br/><strong>Action:</strong> now, click on the 'Next' button or use the right arrow of your keyboard to proceed into your tour.
#rowStatTable1; Here you can select your gene of interest
#redDimPlot2; This is low-dimensional (tSNE) representation of the transcriptomic data. Here, each point represents a cell. Cells are coloured according to  clusters / CD8 T cell states.
#featAssayPlot1; These Violin Plots show single-cell gene expression values for the gene of interest, in the different CD8 TIL states. 
#redDimPlot1; This is a tSNE plot to visualize high-dimensional transcriptomic data. Here, each point represents a cell. Different shapes represent different TIL state and color scale indicates the expression value for the selected gene. 
#panelOrganization;You can reorganize the panels (i.e., plots and tables) using this sidebar, shift panels up and down and remove them
#redDimPlot1_Modify;Your can change the width or height of the panel
#redDimPlot1_DataBoxOpen;For each plot panel, a variety of parameters are available to control the appearance and behaviour of the plot. These parameters are located in these collapsible boxes, such as the <font color="#402ee8">Data parameters</font> box that contains parameters related to the type of data being shown.<br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> please click on the header of this collapsible box to see the available options.
#featAssayPlot1;Two types of point selection are available in iSEE. The first is to use a Shiny brush, which allows users to select a rectangular area by clicking, holding, and dragging the mouse pointer. We also provide support for a polygon-lasso by single clicks to define lasso waypoints, and then a final click at the first waypoint to close the lasso. <br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> try brushing by selecting an area in this plot that contains a subset of cells.
#featAssayPlot1_PanelGeneralInfo;Some information on the number of selected points is displayed in this element.
#redDimPlot1;You can appreciate how this operation changed the plot, with all non-selected points becoming transparent.
#redDimPlot1;A zooming functionality is also available by first brushing, then double-clicking on the brushed area.<br /><br /><strong>Action:</strong> click and hold to select an area, then release. Now, double click inside the marked area to zoom in. To zoom out to the original plot, double-click on the plot. <br /><br />That's it, enjoy!
